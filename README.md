# Time-Domain Maxwell Solver

TDMS, the Time Domain Maxwell Solver, is a hybrid C++ and MATLAB tool for simulating light propagation through a medium by solving Maxwell's equations.
For further details about the method, please refer to the [PDF documentation](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/gh-doc/masterdoc.pdf).

## Prerequisites

We don't ship binaries at the moment, so to use TDMS, it has to be compiled.
It needs to be built against [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/) and [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), which must be downloaded and installed first.

<details>
<summary>Windows prerequisite setup</summary>

TDMS has been tested with **Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)** and natively with the SDK on Windows 10.
 
If you're a complete beginner we recommend you download the [Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install), or set up an linux virtual machine, and follow the linux instructions.
If you can't (or don't want to) do this for some reason, you'll need to install the [Windows software developer kit (SDK)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) which contains the Windows C++ compiler, [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), and then [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/), the latter works via [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fftw).
 
You'll also need [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
Note: MATLAB inside WSL2 is not _officially_ supported but does work (and we still recommend this as the most straightforward).
You may have to do [some setup to ensure your license key is recognised](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/1696925-matlab-licence-using-both-window11-and-wsl2).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux and MacOS prerequisite setup</summary>

Assuming you don't already have them, you'll need a C++ compiler, CMake, OpenMP and FFTW.
 
For Debian-based distributions this should be as simple as
```{sh}
sudo apt install git gcc cmake libfftw3-dev libgomp1
```

On MacOS you will need an x86 compiler with libraries for OpenMP.
You'll need to download the latest [xcode tools](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode).
And everything else can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with the command:

```{sh}
brew install cmake fftw llvm
```

On an ARM Mac, you will need to install the x86 version of Homebrew.
To do so, use the following commands:

```{sh}
arch -x86_64 zsh
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install cmake fftw llvm
```
------
 
You'll need to download and install [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), and take note where the headers are installed.
</details>

## Getting started

To compile and install, follow these steps:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:UCL/TDMS.git
$ cd TDMS
$ git checkout v1.0.0 # the stable version
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ../tdms \
# -DMatlab_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2019b/ \
# -DFFTW_ROOT=/usr/local/fftw3/ \
# -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/
$ make install
```

If CMake cannot find MATLAB, FFTW, or install to the default installation prefix, uncomment the relevant line(s) and modify the path(s) accordingly.

<details>
<summary>Mac-specific instructions</summary>

 After installing with Homebrew, you may need to set the following CMake arguments:

```{sh}
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/Users/username/.local/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++
-DOMP_ROOT=/Users/username/.local/homebrew/opt/llvm/
-DCXX_ROOT=/Users/username/.local/homebrew/opt/llvm
```

On an ARM Mac, you will need to install the x86 version of Homebrew.
To do so, use the following commands:

```{sh}
arch -x86_64 zsh
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew install llvm
```
</details>

You can check that `tdms` was installed correctly and is in your `PATH` by running:
```{sh}
tdms --help
```
in a new terminal.

## How to run

You can run TDMS either directly or from a MATLAB script.
For beginners, we recommend starting with the demonstration MATLAB script, which you can find in the `examples/arc_01` directory.
Move into this directory, launch MATLAB, and run the MATLAB script [`run_pstd_bscan.m`](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/examples/arc_01/run_pstd_bscan.m).
This script will generate the input to TDMS, run TDMS, and display sample output.

If you want to run TDMS standalone at the command line, the basic operation is with two arguments: an input file containing simulation parameters, and an output file name.
You can choose between two solver methods: pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD, the default) or finite-difference (FDTD, with option `--finite-difference`).

TDMS is parallelized with [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP).
You can set the maximum number of threads using the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before calling the TDMS executable.

```{sh}
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 # for example
```
