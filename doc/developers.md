# Developer documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation for TDMS, the Time Domain Maxwell Solver.
These pages contain the C++ API documentation as well as some other useful information for developers.

- üê£ If you are a new user, you probably want to start with the project's [README.md](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/README.md) on github. There are installation and "getting started" instructions.
- üêõ If you've spotted a bug or want to request a feature, we have a short [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Then please [send an issue through github](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/issues).
- If you want to contribute to the development (üöÄ!) and have read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), you're in the right place.

## What?

The physics background and numerical methods used by TDMS are described in [this pdf document](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/gh-doc/masterdoc.pdf) (the source is in [doc/latex](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/doc/latex)).
In terms of the code, `tdms` is a C++ binary that can be installed in your path.
We build with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to be moderately platform-independent. We run continuous integration builds and tests on Windows, Ubuntu, and MacOS.

### Dependencies

We depend on ...

* [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) for parallelization.
* [fftw](https://www.fftw.org/) to calculate numerical derivatives (numerical_derivative.h)
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for logging (this is installed automatically by a CMake [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) if not found).
* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) since we read in and write out MATLAB format files. We are actually thinking of removing this as a strict dependency ([#70](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/issues/70)).

### Code style and other admin

We try to stick to [Google style C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) wherever practicable. <!-- And we run `clang-format` and `cppclean` linters as part of our CI. -->
There is one exception: we prefer `#pragma once` at the top of each header (because it's one line rather than three and is almost the standard anyway).

Please keep doxygen-style comments in the **headers**.
```{.cpp}
/**
 * Add two numbers together
 *
 * @param a: real number
 * @param b: real number
 * @return sum of a and b
 */
double add(double a, double b);
```
And please document the header itself with at least:
```{.cpp}
/**
 * @file filename.h
 *
 * Describe the functions/classes in here.
 */
 #pragma once
```
You can quickly check the documentation for your changes look correct with:
```{.sh}
doxygen doc/Doxygen
firefox html/index.html # or your web browser of choice
```
You should be able to find and read what you've changed.
Don't worry about doxygen for the source files (although obviously please do write helpful comments there).

For Python code (e.g. in the [tests](#system-tests)) we use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to enforce the code style.
To apply automatic code styling to staged changes in git we recommend [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).
If you don't have it already:
```{.sh}
pip3 install pre-commit
```

Then from the root repository directory you can add the pre-commit hooks with
```{.sh}
ls .git/hooks
pre-commit install
ls .git/hooks
```

### Compiling and debugging {#compiling}

Once you've checked the code out, compile with:
```{.sh}
cd tdms
mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. \
# -DMatlab_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2019b/ \
# -DFFTW_ROOT=/usr/local/fftw3/ \
# -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/
make install
```
You may need to help CMake find MATLAB/fftw etc.

- By default, build testing is turned off. You can turn it on with `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`.
- Also by default, debug printout is off. Turn on with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` or manually at some specific place in the code with:
```{.cpp}
spdlog::set_level(spdlog::level::debug);

// ...

spdlog::debug("Send help");
```

### Compiling on UCL's `myriad` nodes

**Warning**
These instructions are a bit experimental. Please use with care (and report anything that's wrong here)!

If you want to test changes on UCL's [myriad](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/) (and/or don't have MATLAB on your pesonal machine) you can try these instructions...
```{.sh}
module purge
module load beta-modules
module load gcc-libs/9.2.0 compilers/gnu/9.2.0 xorg-utils matlab/full/r2021a/9.10 fftw/3.3.6-pl2/gnu-4.9.2 cmake/3.21.1
cd tdms
mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. 
```
</details>


## Where's the main?

The C++ `main` function is in openandorder.cpp <!-- words with a dot in them are assumed to be files so this will hyperlink to openandorder.cpp iff *that* file is also documented. --> however this only really does file I/O and setup.
The main FDTD algorithm code is in iterator.cpp <!-- won't be linked as an undocumented file doesn't exist for doxygen... this is fine, we can link to the real file in github.--> and classes included therein.

## Testing

We have two [levels of tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Testing_levels): unit tests, and full system tests.

### Unit 
The unit tests use [catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/Readme.md#top) macros. See [tests/unit](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/tdms/tests/unit) for good examples in the actual test code, but as a rough sketch you need:

```{.cpp}
#include <catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp>
#include "things_to_be_tested.h"

TEST_CASE("Write a meaningful test case name") {
    // set up function calls or whatever
    REQUIRE_THROW(<something>)
    CHECK(<something>)
}
```
To run the unit tests, [compile](#compiling) with `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON` and then run `ctest` from the build directory or execute the test executable `./tdms_tests`.

It's good practice, and reassuring for your pull-request reviewers, if new C++ functionality is at covered by unit tests.

### System {#system-tests}

The full system tests are written in Python 3, and call the `tdms` executable for known inputs and compare to expected outputs.
We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) and our example data is provided as zip files on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). 

There are a few [python packages you will need](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/tdms/tests/requirements.txt) before running the tests so run:
```{.sh}
pip3 install -r tdms/tests/requirements.txt
```
if you don't already have them.

When you run the tests for the first time, the example data will be downloaded to `tdms/tests/system/data` (which is [ignored by git](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/.gitignore)).
Subsequent runs of the test will not redownload unless you manually delete the zip file.

A good example of running the `tdms` executable for a given input and expected output is [test_arc01.py](https://github.com/UCL/TDMS/blob/main/tdms/tests/system/test_arc01.py)

You need to [compile](#compiling) `tdms`, then the system tests can be run, e.g. from the build directory:

```{.sh}
py.test ../tests/system/
```
